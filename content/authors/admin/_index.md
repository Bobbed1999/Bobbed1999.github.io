I am a PhD in Robotics & AI. My research focuses on multimodal perception, causal reinforcement learning, and embodied intelligence, with applications in human–robot interaction and vision–language–action (VLA) systems. I aim to develop generalizable AI agents that learn from human guidance and adapt to real-world environments.
